This is capstone project for "Data mining in R" course, spring semester 2023

Using the Spotify API, I gathered information on Taylor Swift’s entire discography, including album names, track titles, and popularity rankings. Then I used the Genius API to scrape the lyrics for each track. By combining the data from both sources, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of Taylor Swift’s music and the themes and ideas that inspire her songwriting.
